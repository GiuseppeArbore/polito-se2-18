## PROCESS MEASURES

### Macro statistics

For this sprint, the team selected 2 stories to complete, with a total of 13 story points planned and committed to by the end.
In addition to the stories, we've worked on technical dept.
The initial estimation made during the planning meeting was 80 hours 45 minutes, while the actual time spent was **add** hours and **add** minutes, completing the sprint slightly above the planned estimate.

**Sum-up**

| Metric           | Planned/Committed       | Actual/Completed        |
| ---------------- | ----------------------- | ----------------------- |
| **Stories**      | 2 (plus technical debt) | 2 (plus technical debt) |
| **Story Points** | 13                      | 13                      |
| **Hours**        | 80 hours 45 min         | **add**                 |

### Quality Assurance Highlights

- **Unit Tests:** All unit tests are passing, ensuring stable and reliable code at the module level.
- **Code Review:** The code has been rigorously reviewed, ensuring adherence to best practices and improved code quality.
- **Version Control System (VCS):** Code is fully tracked and stored in VCS, ensuring version integrity and traceability.
- **End-to-End Testing:** Comprehensive end-to-end tests have been completed to validate functionality across all components.

- Unit Tests passing
- Code review completed
- Code present on VCS
- End-to-End tests performed


### Detailed statistics

| Story                                      | # Tasks | Points | Hours est. | Hours actual |
| ------------------------------------------ | ------- | ------ | ---------- | ------------ |
| _#0_                                       | 23      | -      | 70h 15m    | **add**      |
| KX-8 Search documents                      | 3       | 5      | 8h 00m     | 8h 15m       |
| KX-9 Define the geolocated area on the map | 1       | 8      | 2h 30m     | 3h 05m       |


- Hours per task (average, standard deviation)  (2h 34m, 5m)
- Total task estimation error ratio: sum of total hours estimation / sum of total hours spent -1 = 6.4%


## QUALITY MEASURES

  - Total hours estimated: 8 hours
  - Total hours spent: 7 hours
  - Nr of automated unit test cases 
- E2E testing:
  - Total hours estimated 10 hours
  - Total hours spent 11 hours
- Code review
  - Total hours estimated 10 hours
  - Total hours spent 10 hours 40m
- Technical Debt management:
  - Strategy adopted **priority first**
  - Total hours estimated estimated at sprint planning 38 hours
  - Total hours spent 34 hours

## ASSESSMENT

- What caused your errors in estimation (if any)?

  > Different people's ability to complete the same tasks causes us to write down an average estimate that produces errors depending on who takes them.

- What lessons did you learn (both positive and negative) in this sprint?

  > Improved time management emerged as a critical area to focus on for future sprints.
  > Addressing technical skill gaps within the team is a priority to enhance overall performance.
  > Improved resiliency about changes both in project structure and priority of user stories


- Which improvement goals set in the previous retrospective were you able to achieve?
  - [x] Reassign tasks if necessary.
  - [ ] Strengthen internal communication.
  - [ ] Enhance time management.
- Which ones you were not able to achieve? Why?
  - Strengthen internal communication:
    - Team members assume information has been shared or understood without confirming, and there are insufficient feedback loops to ensure clarity.
    - Busy Schedules and Overlapping Priorities: Team members focus too heavily on individual tasks, leaving little time to align with others.
  - Enhance time management:
    - The lack of expertise caused a waterfall effect that made the time management really tough  

- Improvement goals for the next sprint and how to achieve them (technical tasks, team coordination, etc.)
   - [ ] Strengthen internal communication.
   - [ ] Enhance time management (Prepare the demo more structurally) 


- One thing you are proud of as a Team!!
  Despite setbacks, the team remained flexible and resourceful, finding solutions and staying focused on delivering high-quality results.
